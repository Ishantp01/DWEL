1. Core Functionality:
 we should prioritize budget planning and we should include income tracking alongside expenses. We should use visual indicators for over spending budget and we don't need an automatic category suggestions based on expense patterns but unused budget should rollover to next month.
 
2.User Management:
we need OAuth for google login and there should be a password recovery system and there no need for 2FA implementation. User can have multiple profiles and there should be a shared budget feature.

3. Technical Requirements:
 yes we should encrypt data at rest and we are using CCPA. We are expecting 500 concurrent user and Maximum acceptable latency for budget calculations is 40ms. we need weekly reporting to are user and we should support pdf and csv.

4. UX/UI Considerations:
 we are using pie chart and bar graph and you should also make ui/ux morden type and we don't need a dark and light mode. and we are gonna make responsive web app and we don't need to plan for app canversion.  

5. Deployment & Maintenance
well we cloud use aws in future but it's for later. yes we Need error tracking and we Should we implement usage analytic and you can choose your own rto/rpo for user data.

6. Legal & Compliance:
we Should we implement data deletion requests and we don't need a cookie consent management.
and we should have paypal and phonePe integration.

and you can choose other things by your self and first update and think how you develop all those things then wait for responce than start.
